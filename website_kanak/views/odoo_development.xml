                                    <p class="text-justify">Odoo is an Open source ERP software that is based on Python language. Due to Odoo being open source, any company can play around with it and customize it as much as possible. </p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Odoo is modular and hence any company can use the modules that they require and doesn’t need to implement everything at once. Odoo is easier to customize and implement as compared to other commonly used ERPs such as SAP. </p>
                                    <p class="text-justify">Odoo is free to use and its implementation or customization from a third-party vendor is still very cost-effective. This made Odoo a favorite amongst SMEs and it gained popularity fairly quickly. </p>
